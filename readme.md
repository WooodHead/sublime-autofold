# Sublime AutoFold

### Sublime Text 3 plugin for auto-folding tags and attributes from HTML, XML and other markup language files

Instead of having more then 80 chars URLs in one line like this:
![unfolded](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fermads/sublime-autofold/master/img/unfolded.png)


You'll automatically have them folded when you save your files:
